What is the problem?
The problem is to convert a manual system into an automated one.
---
Why is it important to solve the problem?
This is done to save the time and help the users to keep a record for themselves toavoid any sort of confusion and conflicts.
---
What are the possible solutions to the problem?
This problem can be easily solved on any of the following programming language
VB
---
What exactly are the data input to the system and what exactly are the data outputrequired of the system?Data input to the system may be:
•Id of administrator or user 
•Password of administrator 
•USER_ID that is unique.
•USER passwordData output to the system may be:
•Admin page
•User Main Page
•Employee details
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXISTING SYSTEM
The HR Administration falls short of controlling the employee’s activities in analyzing his/her strengths and weakness. The decision for appraisal of assigning next project to the employee or to show him/her the deadline of project – where lies with proper projection. He is not providedwith the detailed project information done or to be assigned based on Application / Verticals.
1.DRAWBACKS IN EXISTING SYSTEM:
Need of extra manual effort.
It used to take much time to find any employee
Not very much accurate.
Does not provide any information about client.
Deadline of project not shown to employees.
Danger of losing the files in some cases.
 -------------------------- -------------------------------------------
BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM
The new system will not only increase the efficiency of the system but also Provide user friendlyinterface. The user will have easy access of the various forms. This will not only increase theclarity in the working style of the System but also reduces the valuable resources.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:
Very fast and accurate.
No need of any extra manual effort.
No fever of data loss.
Just need a little knowledge to operate the system.
Doesn’t require any extra hardware device.
Employees on their main form get the message of project deadline coming.
Provide information about clients.
At last very easy to find the employees.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
END USERS TO THE SYSTEM
The system is permitted to allow two types of users:
1.ADMIN LEVEL USER:
The user at the admin level also acts as the administrator of the system and can excise fullcontrol to the system resources.The admin level user is entitled to perform the following tasks.
•Perform transaction level data entry based as per the system requirements.
•View the project details issued to each employee.

View the details of each employee their employee id, departments, salary information, project details etc.
•Create new client and project in the database.
•Performing miscellaneous operations like editing, deleting any employee records, projectdetails, salary details etc.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.AUTHORIZED LEVEL USER:
The user at this level is allowed to perform the following tasks on the system:
•Perform transaction level data entry as per the system requirements.
•View his/her profile.
•View the project details assigned to his/her.
•Performing miscellaneous operations like changing his login password for proper security measures
